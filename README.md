**Recurly Rails**

I went searching for some sample rails integrations with Rails and couldn't find one.  So, I've built my own. There appears to be an old recurly demo rails app but from the looks of it is not Rails v3.  So I decided to build my own.   

Once this is completed, you should be able to simply fork and clone the project and have recurly up and running with your own pricing page, payment page, and login integration.
